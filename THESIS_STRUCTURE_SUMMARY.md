## 🎯 Research Focus Summary

### Main Topic
**Continuous-Variable Quantum Steering in Raman-Driven Quantum Beat Lasers (RDQBL)**

### Key Distinctions from Prior Work
- Focus on **steering** (asymmetric) rather than **entanglement** (symmetric)
- Use of **Raman-driven** systems for enhanced coherence
- **Quantum beat** control for tunability
- Phase-controlled steering directionality

### Key Research Questions Addressed
1. Can continuous-variable quantum steering be generated reliably in RDQBL?
2. Can steering directionality be controlled?
3. Is RDQBL steering robust under realistic dissipation?
4. Does RDQBL steering fit within the quantum correlation hierarchy?

### Main Contributions
1. First comprehensive treatment of steering in Raman-driven systems
2. Demonstration of phase-controlled tunability of steering directionality
3. Verification of quantum correlation hierarchy in active laser systems
4. Establishment of robustness under realistic cavity damping
5. Practical roadmap for experimental implementation
